// It used to be three lines in the burger menu — clear the socket, ask the
// background to forget the password, navigate — which meant that locking from
// anywhere else (the auto-lock, removing a wallet, switching wallets) did some
// subset of that. In particular nothing ever cleared the decrypted keystore or
// told connected sites the address was gone, so a site kept showing an account
// for a wallet the person believed they had just shut.
